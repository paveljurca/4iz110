NAME
     ftp  Internet file transfer program

SYNOPSIS
     ftp [-46pinegvd] [host [port]]
     pftp [-46inegvd] [host [port]]

DESCRIPTION
     Ftp is the user interface to the Internet standard File Transfer Proto
     col.  The program allows a user to transfer files to and from a remote
     network site.

     Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command inter
     preter.

     -4    Use only IPv4 to contact any host.

     -6    Use IPv6 only.

     -p    Use passive mode for data transfers. Allows use of ftp in environ
           ments where a firewall prevents connections from the outside world

     -4    Use only IPv4 to contact any host.

     -6    Use IPv6 only.

     -p    Use passive mode for data transfers. Allows use of ftp in environ
           ments where a firewall prevents connections from the outside world
           back to the client machine. Requires that the ftp server support
           the PASV command. This is the default if invoked as pftp.

     -i    Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.

     -n    Restrains ftp from attempting auto-login upon initial connection.
           If auto-login is enabled, ftp will check the .netrc (see netrc(5))
           file in the user's home directory for an entry describing an
           account on the remote machine.  If no entry exists, ftp will prompt
           for the remote machine login name (default is the user identity on
           the local machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an
           account with which to login.

     -e    Disables command editing and history support, if it was compiled
           into the ftp executable. Otherwise, does nothing.

     -g    Disables file name globbing.

     -v    Verbose option forces ftp to show all responses from the remote
           server, as well as report on data transfer statistics.

     -d    Enables debugging.

     The client host and an optional port number with which ftp is to communi
     cate may be specified on the command line.  If this is done, ftp will
     immediately attempt to establish a connection to an FTP server on that
     host; otherwise, ftp will enter its command interpreter and await
     instructions from the user.  When ftp is awaiting commands from the user
     the prompt ftp> is provided to the user.  The following commands are
     recognized by ftp:

     ! [command [args]]
                 Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine.  If there
                 are arguments, the first is taken to be a command to execute
                 directly, with the rest of the arguments as its arguments.

     $ macro-name [args]
                 Execute the macro macro-name that was defined with the macdef
                 command.  Arguments are passed to the macro unglobbed.

     account [passwd]
                 Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system
                 for access to resources once a login has been successfully
                 completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be
                 prompted for an account password in a non-echoing input mode.

     append local-file [remote-file]
                 Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If
                 remote-file is left unspecified, the local file name is used
                 in naming the remote file after being altered by any ntrans
                 or nmap setting.  File transfer uses the current settings for
                 type, format, mode, and structure.
 Manual page ftp(1) line 17 (press h for help or q to quit)
     -4    Use only IPv4 to contact any host.

           file in the user's home directory for an entry describing an
           account on the remote machine.  If no entry exists, ftp will prompt
           for the remote machine login name (default is the user identity on
           the local machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an

 Manual page ftp(1) line 17 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~     account [passwd]
                 Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system
                 for access to resources once a login has been successfully
                 completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be
                 prompted for an account password in a non-echoing input mod e.

     append local-file [remote-file]
                 Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If
                 remote-file is left unspecified, the local file name is use d
                 in naming the remote file after being altered by any ntrans
                 or nmap setting.  File transfer uses the current settings f or
                 type, format, mode, and structure.

     ascii       Set the file transfer type to network ASCII.  This is the
                 default type.

     bell        Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer com 
                 mand is completed.

     binary      Set the file transfer type to support binary image transfer .

     bye         Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit
                 ftp.  An end of file will also terminate the session and
                 exit.

     case        Toggle remote computer file name case mapping during mget
                 commands.  When case is on (default is off), remote compute r
                 file names with all letters in upper case are written in th e
                 local directory with the letters mapped to lower case.

     cd remote-directory
                 Change the working directory on the remote machine to
                 remote-directory.

     cdup        Change the remote machine working directory to the parent o f
                 the current remote machine working directory.

     chmod mode file-name
                 Change the permission modes of the file file-name on the
                 remote sytem to mode.

     close       Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and retur n
                 to the command interpreter.  Any defined macros are erased.

     cr          Toggle carriage return stripping during ascii type file
                 retrieval.  Records are denoted by a carriage return/linefe ed
                 sequence during ascii type file transfer.  When cr is on (t he
 Manual page ftp(1) line 64 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~                 default), carriage returns are stripped from this sequence  to
                 conform with the UNIX single linefeed record delimiter.
                 Records on non-UNIX remote systems may contain single line
                 feeds; when an ascii type transfer is made, these linefeeds
                 may be distinguished from a record delimiter only when cr i s
                 off.

     qc          Toggle the printing of control characters in the output of
                 ASCII type commands.  When this is turned on, control chara c
                 ters are replaced with a question mark if the output file i s
                 the standard output.  This is the default when the standard
                 output is a tty.

     delete remote-file
                 Delete the file remote-file on the remote machine.

     debug [debug-value]
                 Toggle debugging mode.  If an optional debug-value is speci 
                 fied it is used to set the debugging level.  When debugging
                 is on, ftp prints each command sent to the remote machine,
                 preceded by the string -->

     dir [remote-directory] [local-file]
                 Print a listing of the directory contents in the directory,
                 remote-directory, and, optionally, placing the output in
                 local-file.  If interactive prompting is on, ftp will promp t
                 the user to verify that the last argument is indeed the tar 
                 get local file for receiving dir output.  If no directory i s
                 specified, the current working directory on the remote
                 machine is used.  If no local file is specified, or
                 local-file is -, output comes to the terminal.

     disconnect  A synonym for close.

     form format
                 Set the file transfer form to format.  The default format i s
                 file.

     get remote-file [local-file]
                 Retrieve the remote-file and store it on the local machine.
                 If the local file name is not specified, it is given the sa me
                 name it has on the remote machine, subject to alteration by
                 the current case, ntrans, and nmap settings.  The current
                 settings for type, form, mode, and structure are used while
                 transferring the file.

     glob        Toggle filename expansion for mdelete, mget and mput.  If
                 globbing is turned off with glob, the file name arguments a  Manual page ftp(1) line 111 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~re
                 taken literally and not expanded.  Globbing for mput is don e
                 as in csh(1).  For mdelete and mget, each remote file name  is
                 expanded separately on the remote machine and the lists are
                 not merged.  Expansion of a directory name is likely to be
                 different from expansion of the name of an ordinary file: t he
                 exact result depends on the foreign operating system and ft p
                 server, and can be previewed by doing mls remote-files -
                 Note: mget and mput are not meant to transfer entire direc
                 tory subtrees of files.  That can be done by transferring a
                 tar(1) archive of the subtree (in binary mode).

     hash        Toggle hash-sign (``#'') printing for each data block trans 
                 ferred.  The size of a data block is 1024 bytes.

     help [command]
                 Print an informative message about the meaning of command.
                 If no argument is given, ftp prints a list of the known com 
                 mands.

     idle [seconds]
                 Set the inactivity timer on the remote server to seconds se c
                 onds.  If seconds is omitted, the current inactivity timer  is
                 printed.

     ipany       Allow the address resolver to return any address family.

     ipv4        Restrict the address resolver to look only for IPv4
                 addresses.

     ipv6        Restrict host adressing to IPv6 only.

     lcd [directory]
                 Change the working directory on the local machine.  If no
                 directory is specified, the user's home directory is used.

     ls [remote-directory] [local-file]
                 Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remot e
                 machine.  The listing includes any system-dependent informa 
                 tion that the server chooses to include; for example, most
                 UNIX systems will produce output from the command ls -l.
                 (See also nlist.)  If remote-directory is left unspecified,
                 the current working directory is used.  If interactive
                 prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that th e
                 last argument is indeed the target local file for receiving
                 ls output.  If no local file is specified, or if local-file
                 is -, the output is sent to the terminal.

     macdef macro-name
                 Define a macro.  Subsequent lines are stored as the macro
                 macro-name; a null line (consecutive newline characters in  a
                 file or carriage returns from the terminal) terminates macr o
                 input mode.  There is a limit of 16 macros and 4096 total
                 characters in all defined macros.  Macros remain defined
                 until a close command is executed.  The macro processor
                 interprets `$' and `\' as special characters.  A `$' follow ed
                 by a number (or numbers) is replaced by the corresponding
                 argument on the macro invocation command line.  A `$' fol
                 lowed by an `i' signals that macro processor that the execu t
                 ing macro is to be looped.  On the first pass `$i' is
                 replaced by the first argument on the macro invocation com
                 mand line, on the second pass it is replaced by the second
                 argument, and so on.  A `\' followed by any character is
                 replaced by that character.  Use the `\' to prevent special
                 treatment of the `$'.

     mdelete [remote-files]
                 Delete the remote-files on the remote machine.

     mdir remote-files local-file
                 Like dir, except multiple remote files may be specified.  I f
                 interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to ve r
                 ify that the last argument is indeed the target local file
                 for receiving mdir output.

     mget remote-files
                 Expand the remote-files on the remote machine and do a get
                 for each file name thus produced.  See glob for details on
                 the filename expansion.  Resulting file names will then be
                 processed according to case, ntrans, and nmap settings.
                 Files are transferred into the local working directory, whi ch
                 can be changed with lcd directory; new local directories
                 can be created with ! mkdir directory.

     mkdir directory-name
                 Make a directory on the remote machine.

     mls remote-files local-file
                 Like nlist, except multiple remote files may be specified,
                 and the local-file must be specified.  If interactive promp t
                 ing is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the last
                 argument is indeed the target local file for receiving mls
                 output.

     mode [mode-name]
                 Set the file transfer mode to mode-name.  The default mode  is
 Manual page ftp(1) line 205 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~                 stream mode.

     modtime file-name
                 Show the last modification time of the file on the remote
                 machine.

     mput local-files
                 Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as argu
                 ments and do a put for each file in the resulting list.  Se e
                 glob for details of filename expansion.  Resulting file nam es
                 will then be processed according to ntrans and nmap setting s.

     newer file-name [local-file]
                 Get the file only if the modification time of the remote fi le
                 is more recent that the file on the current system.  If the
                 file does not exist on the current system, the remote file  is
                 considered newer.  Otherwise, this command is identical to
                 get.

     nlist [remote-directory] [local-file]
                 Print a  list of the files in a directory on the remote
                 machine.  If remote-directory is left unspecified, the cur
                 rent working directory is used.  If interactive prompting i s
                 on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the last argume nt
                 is indeed the target local file for receiving nlist output.
                 If no local file is specified, or if local-file is -, the
                 output is sent to the terminal.

     nmap [inpattern outpattern]
                 Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism.  If no argumen ts
                 are specified, the filename mapping mechanism is unset.  If
                 arguments are specified, remote filenames are mapped during
                 mput commands and put commands issued without a specified
                 remote target filename.  If arguments are specified, local
                 filenames are mapped during mget commands and get commands
                 issued without a specified local target filename.  This com 
                 mand is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote compute r
                 with different file naming conventions or practices.  The
                 mapping follows the pattern set by inpattern and outpattern .
                 [Inpattern] is a template for incoming filenames (which may
                 have already been processed according to the ntrans and cas e
                 settings).  Variable templating is accomplished by includin g
                 the sequences `$1', `$2', ..., `$9' in inpattern.  Use `\'  to
                 prevent this special treatment of the `$' character.  All
 Manual page ftp(1) line 254 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~                 other characters are treated literally, and are used to
                 determine the nmap [inpattern] variable values.  For exampl e,
                 given inpattern $1.$2 and the remote file name "mydata.data ",
                 $1 would have the value "mydata", and $2 would have the val ue
                 "data".  The outpattern determines the resulting mapped fil e
                 name.  The sequences `$1', `$2', ...., `$9' are replaced by
                 any value resulting from the inpattern template.  The
                 sequence `$0' is replace by the original filename.  Additio n
                 ally, the sequence [seq1, seq2] is replaced by [seq1] if
                 seq1 is not a null string; otherwise it is replaced by seq2 .
                 For example, the command

                       nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]

                 would yield the output filename "myfile.data" for input fil e
                 names "myfile.data" and "myfile.data.old", "myfile.file" fo r
                 the input filename "myfile", and "myfile.myfile" for the
                 input filename ".myfile".  Spaces may be included in
                 outpattern, as in the example: `nmap $1 sed "s/  *$//" > $1 '
                 .  Use the `\' character to prevent special treatment of th e
                 `$','[','[', and `,' characters.

     ntrans [inchars [outchars]]
                 Set or unset the filename character translation mechanism.
                 If no arguments are specified, the filename character trans 
                 lation mechanism is unset.  If arguments are specified, cha r
                 acters in remote filenames are translated during mput com
                 mands and put commands issued without a specified remote ta r
                 get filename.  If arguments are specified, characters in
                 local filenames are translated during mget commands and get
                 commands issued without a specified local target filename.
                 This command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote
                 computer with different file naming conventions or practice s.
                 Characters in a filename matching a character in inchars ar e
                 replaced with the corresponding character in outchars.  If
                 the character's position in inchars is longer than the leng th
                 of outchars, the character is deleted from the file name.

     open host [port]
                 Establish a connection to the specified host FTP server.  A n
                 optional port number may be supplied, in which case, ftp wi  Manual page ftp(1) line 298 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~ll
                 attempt to contact an FTP server at that port.  If the
                 auto-login option is on (default), ftp will also attempt to
                 automatically log the user in to the FTP server (see below) .

     prompt      Toggle interactive prompting.  Interactive prompting occurs
                 during multiple file transfers to allow the user to selec
                 tively retrieve or store files.  If prompting is turned off
                 (default is on), any mget or mput will transfer all files,
                 and any mdelete will delete all files.

     proxy ftp-command
                 Execute an ftp command on a secondary control connection.
                 This command allows simultaneous connection to two remote f tp
                 servers for transferring files between the two servers.  Th e
                 first proxy command should be an open, to establish the sec 
                 ondary control connection.  Enter the command "proxy ?" to
                 see other ftp commands executable on the secondary connec
                 tion.  The following commands behave differently when pref
                 aced by proxy: open will not define new macros during the
                 auto-login process, close will not erase existing macro def i
                 nitions, get and mget transfer files from the host on the
                 primary control connection to the host on the secondary con 
                 trol connection, and put, mput, and append transfer files
                 from the host on the secondary control connection to the ho st
                 on the primary control connection.  Third party file trans
                 fers depend upon support of the ftp protocol PASV command b y
                 the server on the secondary control connection.

     put local-file [remote-file]
                 Store a local file on the remote machine.  If remote-file i s
                 left unspecified, the local file name is used after process 
                 ing according to any ntrans or nmap settings in naming the
                 remote file.  File transfer uses the current settings for
                 type, format, mode, and structure.

     pwd         Print the name of the current working directory on the remo te
                 machine.

     quit        A synonym for bye.

     quote arg1 arg2 ...
                 The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote F TP
                 server.

     recv remote-file [local-file]
 Manual page ftp(1) line 338 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~                 A synonym for get.

     reget remote-file [local-file]
                 Reget acts like get, except that if local-file exists and i s
                 smaller than remote-file, local-file is presumed to be a pa r
                 tially transferred copy of remote-file and the transfer is
                 continued from the apparent point of failure.  If local-fil e
                 does not exist ftp won't fetch the file.  This command is
                 useful when transferring very large files over networks tha t
                 are prone to dropping connections.

     remotehelp [command-name]
                 Request help from the remote FTP server.  If a command-name
                 is specified it is supplied to the server as well.

     remotestatus [file-name]
                 With no arguments, show status of remote machine.  If
                 file-name is specified, show status of file-name on remote
                 machine.

     rename [from] [to]
                 Rename the file from on the remote machine, to the file to.

     reset       Clear reply queue.  This command re-synchronizes com
                 mand/reply sequencing with the remote ftp server.  Resynchr o
                 nization may be necessary following a violation of the ftp
                 protocol by the remote server.

     restart marker
                 Restart the immediately following get or put at the indicat ed
                 marker.  On UNIX systems, marker is usually a byte offset
                 into the file.

     rmdir directory-name
                 Delete a directory on the remote machine.

     runique     Toggle storing of files on the local system with unique fil e
                 names.  If a file already exists with a name equal to the
                 target local filename for a get or mget command, a ".1" is
                 appended to the name.  If the resulting name matches anothe r
                 existing file, a ".2" is appended to the original name.  If
                 this process continues up to ".99", an error message is
                 printed, and the transfer does not take place.  The generat ed
                 unique filename will be reported.  Note that runique will n ot
                 affect local files generated from a shell command (see
                 below).  The default value is off.

     send local-file [remote-file]
 Manual page ftp(1) line 384 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~                 A synonym for put.

     sendport    Toggle the use of PORT commands.  By default, ftp will
                 attempt to use a PORT command when establishing a connectio n
                 for each data transfer.  The use of PORT commands can preve nt
                 delays when performing multiple file transfers.  If the POR T
                 command fails, ftp will use the default data port.  When th e
                 use of PORT commands is disabled, no attempt will be made t o
                 use PORT commands for each data transfer.  This is useful f or
                 certain FTP implementations which do ignore PORT commands
                 but, incorrectly, indicate they've been accepted.

     site arg1 arg2 ...
                 The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote F TP
                 server as a SITE command.

     size file-name
                 Return size of file-name on remote machine.

     status      Show the current status of ftp.

     struct [struct-name]
                 Set the file transfer structure to struct-name.  By default
                 stream structure is used.

     sunique     Toggle storing of files on remote machine under unique file
                 names.  Remote ftp server must support ftp protocol STOU co m
                 mand for successful completion.  The remote server will
                 report unique name.  Default value is off.

     system      Show the type of operating system running on the remote
                 machine.

     tenex       Set the file transfer type to that needed to talk to TENEX
                 machines.

     trace       Toggle packet tracing.

     type [type-name]
                 Set the file transfer type to type-name.  If no type is spe c
                 ified, the current type is printed.  The default type is ne t
                 work ASCII.

     umask [newmask]
                 Set the default umask on the remote server to newmask.  If
                 newmask is omitted, the current umask is printed.

     user user-name [password] [account]
 Manual page ftp(1) line 432 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~                 Identify yourself to the remote FTP server.  If the passwor d
                 is not specified and the server requires it, ftp will promp t
                 the user for it (after disabling local echo).  If an accoun t
                 field is not specified, and the FTP server requires it, the
                 user will be prompted for it.  If an account field is speci 
                 fied, an account command will be relayed to the remote serv er
                 after the login sequence is completed if the remote server
                 did not require it for logging in.  Unless ftp is invoked
                 with auto-login disabled, this process is done automati
                 cally on initial connection to the FTP server.

     verbose     Toggle verbose mode.  In verbose mode, all responses from t he
                 FTP server are displayed to the user.  In addition, if ver
                 bose is on, when a file transfer completes, statistics
                 regarding the efficiency of the transfer are reported.  By
                 default, verbose is on.

     ? [command]
                 A synonym for help.

     Command arguments which have embedded spaces may be quoted with quote ` "'
     marks.

ABORTING A FILE TRANSFER
     To abort a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key (usually Ctrl-
     C).  Sending transfers will be immediately halted.  Receiving transfers
     will be halted by sending a ftp protocol ABOR command to the remote
     server, and discarding any further data received.  The speed at which
     this is accomplished depends upon the remote server's support for ABOR
     processing.  If the remote server does not support the ABOR command, an
     ftp> prompt will not appear until the remote server has completed sen d
     ing the requested file.

     The terminal interrupt key sequence will be ignored when ftp has com
     pleted any local processing and is awaiting a reply from the remote
     server.  A long delay in this mode may result from the ABOR processing
     described above, or from unexpected behavior by the remote server,
     including violations of the ftp protocol.  If the delay results from
     unexpected remote server behavior, the local ftp program must be killed
     by hand.

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
     Files specified as arguments to ftp commands are processed according to
     the following rules.

     1.   If the file name - is specified, the stdin (for reading) or stdo ut
          (for writing) is used.

     2.   If the first character of the file name is |, the remainder of t  Manual page ftp(1) line 480 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~he
          argument is interpreted as a shell command.  Ftp then forks a shel l,
          using popen(3) with the argument supplied, and reads (writes) from
          the stdout (stdin).  If the shell command includes spaces, the arg u
          ment must be quoted; e.g.  " ls -lt".  A particularly useful exa m
          ple of this mechanism is: dir more.

     3.   Failing the above checks, if ``globbing'' is enabled, local file
          names are expanded according to the rules used in the csh(1); c.f.
          the glob command.  If the ftp command expects a single local file
          (.e.g.  put), only the first filename generated by the "globbing"
          operation is used.

     4.   For mget commands and get commands with unspecified local file
          names, the local filename is the remote filename, which may be
          altered by a case, ntrans, or nmap setting.  The resulting filenam e
          may then be altered if runique is on.

     5.   For mput commands and put commands with unspecified remote file
          names, the remote filename is the local filename, which may be
          altered by a ntrans or nmap setting.  The resulting filename may
          then be altered by the remote server if sunique is on.

FILE TRANSFER PARAMETERS
     The FTP specification specifies many parameters which may affect a file
     transfer.  The type may be one of ascii, image (binary), ebcdic,
     and local byte size (for PDP-10's and PDP-20's mostly).  Ftp supports
     the ascii and image types of file transfer, plus local byte size 8 for
     tenex mode transfers.

     Ftp supports only the default values for the remaining file transfer
     parameters: mode, form, and struct.

ENVIRONMENT
     Ftp utilizes the following environment variables.

     HOME        For default location of a .netrc file, if one exists.

     SHELL       For default shell.

HISTORY
     The ftp command appeared in 4.2BSD.

BUGS
     Correct execution of many commands depends upon proper behavior by the
     remote server.

     An error in the treatment of carriage returns in the 4.2BSD ascii-mode
     transfer code has been corrected.  This correction may result in incor
     rect transfers of binary files to and from 4.2BSD servers using the asc ii

                 Change the working directory on the local machine.  If no
                 directory is specified, the user's home directory is used.

     ls [remote-directory] [local-file]
                 Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remot e
                 machine.  The listing includes any system-dependent informa 
                 tion that the server chooses to include; for example, most
                 UNIX systems will produce output from the command ls -l.
                 (See also nlist.)  If remote-directory is left unspecified,
                 the current working directory is used.  If interactive
                 prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that th e
                 last argument is indeed the target local file for receiving
                 ls output.  If no local file is specified, or if local-file
                 is -, the output is sent to the terminal.

     macdef macro-name
                 Define a macro.  Subsequent lines are stored as the macro
                 macro-name; a null line (consecutive newline characters in  a
                 file or carriage returns from the terminal) terminates macr o

                 mand/reply sequencing with the remote ftp server.  Resynchr o
                 nization may be necessary following a violation of the ftp
                 protocol by the remote server.

     restart marker
                 Restart the immediately following get or put at the indicat ed
                 marker.  On UNIX systems, marker is usually a byte offset
                 into the file.

     rmdir directory-name
                 Delete a directory on the remote machine.

     runique     Toggle storing of files on the local system with unique fil e
                 names.  If a file already exists with a name equal to the
                 target local filename for a get or mget command, a ".1" is
                 appended to the name.  If the resulting name matches anothe r
                 existing file, a ".2" is appended to the original name.  If
                 this process continues up to ".99", an error message is
                 printed, and the transfer does not take place.  The generat ed
                 unique filename will be reported.  Note that runique will n ot
                 affect local files generated from a shell command (see
                 below).  The default value is off.

     send local-file [remote-file]
                 A synonym for put.

     sendport    Toggle the use of PORT commands.  By default, ftp will
                 attempt to use a PORT command when establishing a connectio n
                 for each data transfer.  The use of PORT commands can preve nt
                 delays when performing multiple file transfers.  If the POR T
                 command fails, ftp will use the default data port.  When th e
                 use of PORT commands is disabled, no attempt will be made t o
                 use PORT commands for each data transfer.  This is useful f or
                 certain FTP implementations which do ignore PORT commands
                 but, incorrectly, indicate they've been accepted.

                 The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote F TP
                 server as a SITE command.

NAME
       curl - transfer a URL

SYNOPSIS
       curl [options] [URL...]

DESCRIPTION
       curl  is  a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the
       supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS,  IMAP,
       IMAPS,  LDAP,  LDAPS,  POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS,
       TELNET and TFTP).  The command is designed to work without user  inter
       action.

       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen
       tication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file  trans
       fer resume and more. As you will see below, the number of features will
       make your head spin!

       curl is powered by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.  See
       libcurl(3) for details.

 Manual page curl(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~URL
       The  URL  syntax is protocol-dependent. You'll find a detailed descrip
       tion in RFC 3986.

       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs  by  writing  part  sets
       within braces as in:

        http://site.{one,two,three}.com

       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

        ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt
        ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt    (with leading zeros)
        ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt

       Nested  sequences  are not supported, but you can use several ones next
       to each other:

        http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html

       You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line.  They  will  be
       fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order.

 Manual page curl(1) line 26 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[44 Manual page curl(1) line 26 (press h for help or q to quit) Manual page curl(1) line 26 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~       You  can  specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number
       or letter:

        http://www.numericals.com/file[1-100:10].txt
        http://www.letters.com/file[a-z:2].txt

       If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix,  curl  will  attempt  to
       guess  what  protocol  you might want. It will then default to HTTP but
       try other protocols based on often-used host name prefixes.  For  exam
       ple,  for  host names starting with "ftp." curl will assume you want to
       speak FTP.

       curl will do its best to use what you pass to it as a URL.  It  is  not
       trying  to  validate it as a syntactically correct URL by any means but
       is instead very liberal with what it accepts.

       Curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so
       that  getting many files from the same server will not do multiple con
       nects / handshakes. This improves speed. Of course this is only done on
       files  specified  on  a  single command line and cannot be used between
       separate curl invokes.

PROGRESS METER
 Manual page curl(1) line 49 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~       curl normally displays a progress meter during  operations,  indicating
       the  amount  of  transferred  data,  transfer speeds and estimated time
       left, etc.

       curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so  if  you  invoke
       curl  to do an operation and it is about to write data to the terminal,
       it disables the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the output
       mixing progress meter and response data.

       If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to
       redirect the response output to a file, using shell  redirect  (>),  -o
       [file] or similar.

       It  is not the same case for FTP upload as that operation does not spit
       out any response data to the terminal.

       If you prefer a progress "bar" instead of the regular meter, -# is your
       friend.

OPTIONS
       In general, all boolean options are enabled with --option and yet again
       disabled with --no-option. That is, you use the exact same option  name
       but prefix it with "no-". However, in this list we mostly only list and

       added  in  7.19.0.  Previously  most  options  were  toggled  on/off on
       repeated use of the same command line option.)

       -#, --progress-bar
              Make curl display progress as a simple progress bar  instead  of
              the standard, more informational, meter.

       -0, --http1.0
              (HTTP)  Forces curl to issue its requests using HTTP 1.0 instead
              of using its internally preferred: HTTP 1.1.

       -1, --tlsv1
              (SSL) Forces curl to use TLS version 1 when negotiating  with  a
              remote TLS server.

       -2, --sslv2
              (SSL)  Forces  curl to use SSL version 2 when negotiating with a
              remote SSL server.

       -3, --sslv3

       -a, --append
              (FTP/SFTP) When used in an upload, this will tell curl to append
              to  the  target  file  instead  of  overwriting  it. If the file
              doesn't exist, it will be  created.   Note  that  this  flag  is
              ignored by some SSH servers (including OpenSSH).

       -A, --user-agent <agent string>
              (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.

              doesn't exist, it will be  created.   Note  that  this  flag  is
              ignored by some SSH servers (including OpenSSH).

       -A, --user-agent <agent string>
              (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.
              Some  badly  done  CGIs  fail  if  this  field  isn't   set   to
              "Mozilla/4.0".  To  encode  blanks  in  the string, surround the
              string with single quote marks. This can also be  set  with  the
 Manual page curl(1) line 118 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              -H, --header option of course.

              If  this  option is set more than once, the last one will be the
              one that's used.

       --anyauth
              (HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself,
              and  use  the most secure one the remote site claims to support.
              This is done by first doing a request and checking the response-
              headers,  thus  possibly  inducing  an extra network round-trip.
              This is  used  instead  of  setting  a  specific  authentication
              method,  which  you  can  do with --basic, --digest, --ntlm, and
              --negotiate.

              Note that using --anyauth is not recommended if you  do  uploads
              from  stdin, since it may require data to be sent twice and then
              the client must be able to rewind. If the need should arise when
              uploading from stdin, the upload operation will fail.

       -b, --cookie <name=data>
              (HTTP)  Pass the data to the HTTP server as a cookie. It is sup
              posedly the data previously received from the server in a  "Set-
              Cookie:"  line.  The data should be in the format "NAME1=VALUE1;
 Manual page curl(1) line 141 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              NAME2=VALUE2".

              If no '=' symbol is used in the line, it is treated as  a  file
              name  to  use to read previously stored cookie lines from, which
              should be used in this session if they match. Using this  method
              also  activates  the "cookie parser" which will make curl record
              incoming cookies too, which may be handy if you're using this in
              combination  with  the -L, --location option. The file format of
              the file to read cookies from should be plain  HTTP  headers  or
              the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format.

              NOTE  that  the file specified with -b, --cookie is only used as
              input. No cookies will be stored in the file. To store  cookies,
              use  the -c, --cookie-jar option or you could even save the HTTP
              headers to a file using -D, --dump-header!

              If this option is set more than once, the last one will  be  the
              one that's used.

       -B, --use-ascii
              Enable  ASCII transfer when using FTP or LDAP. For FTP, this can
              also be enforced by using an URL that ends with ";type=A".  This
              option  causes  data sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32
 Manual page curl(1) line 164 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              systems.

       --basic
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication. This is  the
              default  and this option is usually pointless, unless you use it
              to override a  previously  set  option  that  sets  a  different
              authentication  method  (such  as --ntlm, --digest, or --negoti
              ate).

       -c, --cookie-jar <file name>
              Specify to which file you want curl to write all cookies after a
              completed  operation.  Curl  writes  all cookies previously read
              from a specified file as  well  as  all  cookies  received  from
              remote server(s). If no cookies are known, no file will be writ
              ten. The file will be written using  the  Netscape  cookie  file
              format.  If  you  set  the  file name to a single dash, "-", the
              cookies will be written to stdout.

              This command line option will activate the  cookie  engine  that
              makes curl record and use cookies. Another way to activate it is
              to use the -b, --cookie option.

              If the cookie jar can't be created or written to, the whole curl
 Manual page curl(1) line 187 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              operation  won't  fail or even report an error clearly. Using -v
              will get a warning displayed, but that is the only visible feed
              back you get about this possibly lethal situation.

              If  this  option  is used several times, the last specified file
              name will be used.

       -C, --continue-at <offset>
              Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at  the  given  offset.
              The  given  offset  is  the  exact  number of bytes that will be
              skipped, counting from the beginning of the source  file  before
              it is transferred to the destination.  If used with uploads, the
              FTP server command SIZE will not be used by curl.

              Use "-C -" to tell curl to automatically find out  where/how  to
              resume  the  transfer. It then uses the given output/input files
              to figure that out.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --ciphers <list of ciphers>
              (SSL) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list
              of  ciphers  must  specify  valid ciphers. Read up on SSL cipher

              the others.

       --compressed
              (HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms
              libcurl supports, and save the uncompressed document.   If  this
              option  is  used  and  the server sends an unsupported encoding,
              curl will report an error.

       --connect-timeout <seconds>
              Maximum time in seconds that you allow  the  connection  to  the
              server  to  take.   This  only limits the connection phase, once
              curl has connected this option is of no more use. See  also  the
              -m, --max-time option.

 Manual page curl(1) line 233 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --create-dirs
              When  used  in  conjunction with the -o option, curl will create
              the necessary local directory hierarchy as needed.  This  option
              creates  the dirs mentioned with the -o option, nothing else. If
              the -o file name uses no dir or if the dirs it mentions  already
              exist, no dir will be created.

              To  create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try --ftp-
              create-dirs.

       --crlf (FTP) Convert LF to CRLF in upload. Useful for MVS (OS/390).

       --crlfile <file>
              (HTTPS/FTPS) Provide a file using PEM format with a  Certificate
              Revocation  List  that may specify peer certificates that are to
              be considered revoked.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              (Added in 7.19.7)

 Manual page curl(1) line 256 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~       -d, --data <data>
              (HTTP) Sends the specified data in a POST request  to  the  HTTP
              server,  in  the  same  way  that a browser does when a user has
              filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This  will
              cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type
              application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Compare to -F, --form.

              -d, --data is the same as  --data-ascii.  To  post  data  purely
              binary, you should instead use the --data-binary option. To URL-
              encode the value of a form field you may use --data-urlencode.

              If any of these options is used more than once on the same  com
              mand  line,  the  data  pieces specified will be merged together
              with a separating  &-symbol.  Thus,  using  '-d  name=daniel  -d
              skill=lousy'  would  generate  a  post  chunk  that  looks  like
              'name=daniel&skill=lousy'.

              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest  should  be  a
              file  name  to read the data from, or - if you want curl to read
              the data from stdin.  The contents of the file must  already  be
              URL-encoded.  Multiple files can also be specified. Posting data
              from a file named 'foobar' would thus be done with --data  @foo
              bar.
 Manual page curl(1) line 279 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~
       -D, --dump-header <file>
              Write the protocol headers to the specified file.

              This  option  is handy to use when you want to store the headers
              that a HTTP site sends to you. Cookies from  the  headers  could
              then  be  read  in  a  second  curl  invocation by using the -b,
              --cookie option! The -c, --cookie-jar option is however a better
              way to store cookies.

              When  used  in FTP, the FTP server response lines are considered
              being "headers" and thus are saved there.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
              IP "--data-ascii <data>" See -d, --data.

       --data-binary <data>
              (HTTP)  This  posts data exactly as specified with no extra pro
              cessing whatsoever.

              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest  should  be  a
              filename.   Data  is  posted in a similar manner as --data-ascii
              does, except that newlines are  preserved  and  conversions  are
 Manual page curl(1) line 302 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              never done.

              If  this  option  is  used several times, the ones following the
              first will append data as described in -d, --data.

       --data-urlencode <data>
              (HTTP) This posts data, similar to the other --data options with
              the exception that this performs URL-encoding. (Added in 7.18.0)

              To  be  CGI-compliant,  the <data> part should begin with a name
              followed by a separator and a content specification. The  <data>
              part can be passed to curl using one of the following syntaxes:

              content
                     This  will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that
                     on. Just be careful so that the content  doesn't  contain
                     any  =  or  @  symbols, as that will then make the syntax
                     match one of the other cases below!

              =content
                     This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass  that
                     on. The preceding = symbol is not included in the data.

 Manual page curl(1) line 325 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              name=content
                     This  will make curl URL-encode the content part and pass
                     that on. Note that the name part is expected to  be  URL-
                     encoded already.

              @filename
                     This  will  make  curl  load  data  from  the  given file
                     (including any newlines), URL-encode that data  and  pass
                     it on in the POST.

              name@filename
                     This  will  make  curl  load  data  from  the  given file
                     (including any newlines), URL-encode that data  and  pass
                     it  on  in  the  POST.  The  name part gets an equal sign
                     appended, resulting in name=urlencoded-file-content. Note
                     that the name is expected to be URL-encoded already.

       --delegation LEVEL
              Set LEVEL to tell the server what it is allowed to delegate when
              it comes to user credentials. Used with GSS/kerberos.

              none   Don't allow any delegation.

 Manual page curl(1) line 348 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              policy Delegates if and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag  is  set
                     in  the  Kerberos  service  ticket,  which is a matter of
                     realm policy.

              always Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.

       --digest
              (HTTP) Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is a authentica
              tion that prevents the password from being sent over the wire in
              clear text. Use this in combination with the normal  -u,  --user
              option to set user name and password. See also --ntlm, --negoti
              ate and --anyauth for related options.

              If this option is used several times, the following  occurrences
              make no difference.

       --disable-eprt
              (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands
              when doing active FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first
              attempt  to use EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but with this
              option, it will use PORT right away. EPRT and  LPRT  are  exten
              sions  to  the  original  FTP  protocol, and may not work on all
              servers, but they enable more functionality in a better way than
 Manual page curl(1) line 371 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              the traditional PORT command.

              --eprt can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and --no-eprt
              is an alias for --disable-eprt.

              Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you want  to
              switch  to  passive  mode  you need to not use -P, --ftp-port or
              force it with --ftp-pasv.

       --disable-epsv
              (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use  of  the  EPSV  command  when
              doing  passive  FTP  transfers.  Curl will normally always first
              attempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with this option,  it  will
              not try using EPSV.

              --epsv can be used to explicitly enable EPSV again and --no-epsv
              is an alias for --disable-epsv.

              Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior. If you want to
              switch to active mode you need to use -P, --ftp-port.

       -e, --referer <URL>
              (HTTP)  Sends the "Referer Page" information to the HTTP server.
 Manual page curl(1) line 394 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              This can also be set with the -H, --header flag of course.  When
              used with -L, --location you can append ";auto" to the --referer
              URL to make curl automatically set the previous URL when it fol
              lows  a  Location: header. The ";auto" string can be used alone,
              even if you don't set an initial --referer.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -E, --cert <certificate[:password]>
              (SSL) Tells curl to use the specified  client  certificate  file
              when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another SSL-based proto
              col. The certificate must be in PEM  format.   If  the  optional
              password  isn't  specified, it will be queried for on the termi
              nal. Note that this option assumes a "certificate" file that  is
              the  private  key  and the private certificate concatenated! See
              --cert and --key to specify them independently.

              If curl is built against the NSS SSL library  then  this  option
              can  tell curl the nickname of the certificate to use within the
              NSS database defined by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or  by
              default  /etc/pki/nssdb).  If  the  NSS PEM PKCS#11 module (lib
              nsspem.so) is available then PEM files may  be  loaded.  If  you
              want to use a file from the current directory, please precede it
 Manual page curl(1) line 417 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              with "./" prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --engine <name>
              Select the OpenSSL crypto engine to use for  cipher  operations.
              Use  --engine  list  to  print  a  list  of build-time supported
              engines. Note that not all (or  none)  of  the  engines  may  be
              available at run-time.

       --environment
              (RISC  OS ONLY) Sets a range of environment variables, using the
              names the -w option supports, to allow easier extraction of use
              ful information after having run curl.

       --egd-file <file>
              (SSL)  Specify  the  path  name  to the Entropy Gathering Daemon
              socket. The socket is used to seed the  random  engine  for  SSL
              connections. See also the --random-file option.

       --cert-type <type>
              (SSL)  Tells curl what certificate type the provided certificate
              is in. PEM, DER and ENG are recognized types.  If not specified,
 Manual page curl(1) line 440 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              PEM is assumed.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --cacert <CA certificate>
              (SSL) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify
              the peer. The file may contain  multiple  CA  certificates.  The
              certificate(s)  must be in PEM format. Normally curl is built to
              use a default file for this, so this option is typically used to
              alter that default file.

              curl  recognizes the environment variable named 'CURL_CA_BUNDLE'
              if it is set, and uses the given path as a path  to  a  CA  cert
              bundle. This option overrides that variable.

              The  windows  version  of  curl will automatically look for a CA
              certs file named curl-ca-bundle.crt, either in the same direc
              tory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any
              folder along your PATH.

              If curl is built against the NSS SSL library  then  this  option
              tells  curl the nickname of the CA certificate to use within the
              NSS database defined by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or  by
 Manual page curl(1) line 463 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              default  /etc/pki/nssdb).   If  the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module (lib
              nsspem.so) is available then PEM files may be loaded.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --capath <CA certificate directory>
              (SSL) Tells curl to use the specified certificate  directory  to
              verify  the  peer.  Multiple paths can be provided by separating
              them with ":" (e.g.  "path1:path2:path3"). The certificates must
              be  in  PEM  format,  and  if curl is built against OpenSSL, the
              directory must have been processed using  the  c_rehash  utility
              supplied  with OpenSSL. Using --capath can allow OpenSSL-powered
              curl to make SSL-connections much more  efficiently  than  using
              --cacert if the --cacert file contains many CA certificates.

              If this option is set, the default capath value will be ignored,
              and if it is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -f, --fail
              (HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server  errors.  This
              is  mostly done to better enable scripts etc to better deal with
              failed attempts. In normal cases when a  HTTP  server  fails  to
              deliver  a  document,  it  returns  an  HTML document stating so
 Manual page curl(1) line 486 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              (which often also describes why and more). This flag  will  pre
              vent curl from outputting that and return error 22.

              This  method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-
              successful response codes will  slip  through,  especially  when
              authentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).

       -F, --form <name=content>
              (HTTP)  This  lets curl emulate a filled-in form in which a user
              has pressed the submit button. This causes  curl  to  POST  data
              using  the  Content-Type  multipart/form-data  according  to RFC
              2388. This enables uploading of binary files etc. To  force  the
              'content'  part  to  be  a  file, prefix the file name with an @
              sign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix the  file
              name  with  the symbol <. The difference between @ and < is then
              that @ makes a file get attached in the post as a  file  upload,
              while  the  <  makes  a text field and just get the contents for
              that text field from a file.

              Example, to send your password file to the server, where  'pass
              word' is the name of the form-field to which /etc/passwd will be
              the input:

 Manual page curl(1) line 509 (press h for help or q to quit) ESCESC[[66~~              curl -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com

              To read content from stdin instead of a file, use - as the file
              name. This goes for both @ and < constructs.

              You  can  also  tell  curl  what  Content-Type  to  use by using
              'type=', in a manner similar to:

              curl -F "web=@index.html;type=text/html" url.com

              or

              curl -F "name=daniel;type=text/foo" url.com

              You can also explicitly change the name field of a  file  upload
              part by setting filename=, like this:

              curl -F "file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost" url.com

              See further examples and details in the MANUAL.

              This option can be used multiple times.

              (HTTP)  Include  the  HTTP-header in the output. The HTTP-header
              includes things like server-name, date of  the  document,  HTTP-
              version and more...

       -I, --head
              (HTTP/FTP/FILE) Fetch the HTTP-header only! HTTP-servers feature
              the command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but  the  header
              of  a  document.  When used on a FTP or FILE file, curl displays
              the file size and last modification time only.

       --interface <name>
              Perform an operation using a specified interface. You can  enter
              interface  name,  IP address or host name. An example could look
              like:

               curl --interface eth0:1 http://www.netscape.com/

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -j, --junk-session-cookies
              (HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this
              option  will  make  it  discard all "session cookies". This will
              basically have the same effect as if a new session  is  started.

              This  option  can be used multiple times to load multiple config
              files.

       --keepalive-time <seconds>
              This option sets the time a  connection  needs  to  remain  idle
              before  sending keepalive probes and the time between individual
              keepalive probes. It is currently effective on operating systems
              offering  the  TCP_KEEPIDLE  and  TCP_KEEPINTVL  socket  options
              (meaning Linux, recent AIX, HP-UX and more). This option has  no
              effect if --no-keepalive is used. (Added in 7.18.0)

              If  this option is used multiple times, the last occurrence sets
              the amount. If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.

 Manual page curl(1) line 802 (press h for help or q to quit)/...skipping...
              Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work sit
              uations,  curl  will  use a standard buffered output stream that
              will have the effect that it will output the data in chunks, not
              necessarily  exactly  when  the data arrives.  Using this option
              will disable that buffering.

              Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can
              thus use --buffer to enforce the buffering.

       --netrc-file
              This  option  is similar to --netrc, except that you provide the
              path (absolute or relative) to the netrc file that  Curl  should
              use.   You  can  only  specify one netrc file per invocation. If
              several --netrc-file options are provided,  only  the  last  one
              will be used.  (Added in 7.21.5)

              This  option  overrides  any use of --netrc as they are mutually
              exclusive.  It will also abide by --netrc-optional if specified.

       --netrc-optional
              Very similar to --netrc, but this option makes the .netrc  usage
              optional and not mandatory as the --netrc option does.

       -o, --output <file>
              Write output to <file> instead of stdout. If you are using {} or
              []  to  fetch  multiple documents, you can use '#' followed by a
              number in the <file> specifier. That variable will  be  replaced
              with the current string for the URL being fetched. Like in:

                curl http://{one,two}.site.com -o "file_#1.txt"

              or use several variables like:

                curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o "#1_#2"

              You  may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you
              have.

              See also the --create-dirs option to create the  local  directo
              ries  dynamically.  Specifying the output as '-' (a single dash)
              will force the output to be done to stdout.

       -O, --remote-name
              Write output to a local file named like the remote file we  get.
              (Only  the file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut
              off.)
